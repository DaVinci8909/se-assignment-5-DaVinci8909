               - Variables Pane: View the values of variables at the current point in execution.
               - Call Stack: See the sequence of function calls that led to the current line of code.
               - Stepping:
                  - Step Over (F10): Execute the current line and advance to the next line.
                  - Step Into (F11): Step into function calls, pausing at the first line of the called function.
                  - Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function, continuing execution until the function returns.
                  - Console: Interact with your program's output using the built-in console within VS Code.
                  - Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when a specific condition is met.
      By utilizing these features, you can systematically examine your code's execution, identify errors, and fix issues in your program.


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
      1. Initializing a Git Repository:
         - Open the folder containing your project code in VS Code.
         - Go to the Source Control view (usually on the left side bar). - - You might need to enable it using the View > Source Control menu option if not already visible.
         - Click the "+" icon in the Source Control view and select "Initialize Repository". This creates a new Git repository within your project folder (.git folder) and starts tracking your code changes.
      2. Making Commits:
         - After making changes to your code, stage those changes for the next commit. Staged changes are the ones you want to include in the next version snapshot. You can stage specific lines, entire files, or all modified files.
         - Use the source control view to see unstaged and staged changes.
         - Click the "+" icon next to a file to stage it, or right-click and select "Stage Changes".
         - Once you've staged your desired changes, provide a descriptive commit message summarizing the changes you made.
         - Click on the commit message box at the bottom of the Source Control view.
         - Write a clear and concise message explaining your modifications.
         - Finally, commit your staged changes with a message by clicking the checkmark icon (or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter). This creates a new snapshot of your code with the associated message.
      3. Pushing Changes to GitHub (Optional):
         - If you have a remote repository on GitHub (or any other Git hosting service), you can push your local commits to keep your remote repository in sync.
         - Make sure you've linked your VS Code account with GitHub (refer to VS Code documentation for specific steps).
         - In the Source Control view, you should see a "Publish to GitHub" button (or similar wording) if your remote repository is linked. Click this button.
         - You might be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials if not already saved.
         - VS Code will initiate the push process, uploading your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
